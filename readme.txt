Automatically submits review metadata to OpenCritic when new reviews are published.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the Plugin work? =
The plugin adds a new metabox on Wordpress Posts where you can sycn review metadata with OpenCritic. When your post goes live, the review metadata is transmitted and uploaded straight to OpenCritic.

= Will the review metadata show up on OpenCritic before it's published? =
No. Review metadata is only publicly visible after your Wordpress post becomes published. If you accidentally publish your post early, you can un-publish the post and the metadata will also be removed from OpenCritic.

= Do I need to do anything after the review is scheduled? =
No. The review metadata should be uploaded once your review's status goes from Scheduled to Live.

= Where do I get the API key? =
Log in to the Portal and generate an API key [here](https://portal.opencritic.com/wordpress-plugin-api-key). The plugin will not work unless this API key is set in your API key section. If you're unable to access the API key section, email us at <admin@opencritic.com>.
